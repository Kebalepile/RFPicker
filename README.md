# TenderPick

TenderPick is a lightweight web application designed for **South African SMEs, cooperatives, and first-time bidders** to navigate the tender process with confidence.  

It combines two key features:
1. **Tender Compliance Checker** â€” Upload an RFQ or RFP in PDF format, and get an instant checklist, compliance score, and reminders of missing documents.
2. **Tender List Pro** â€” A curated, scraped feed of official tenders, enriched with summaries of required documents and compliance notes, helping users quickly filter "small fish" vs "big fish" opportunities.
